in this folder logic is implemented to construct a graph based on adjacency matrix.
here the operations performed are create a graph,insert an edge and delete an edge and display
creation_of_graph:graph is created based on the number of vertices and maximum number of vertices
->maximum no of vertices that a tree can have are n*(n-1)
here source and destination nodes should be in the range 0 to n
if negative values are given then it will come out of loop.
same conditions are checked for add edge and delete edge
->execution steps
gcc -o func func.c main.c
./func
