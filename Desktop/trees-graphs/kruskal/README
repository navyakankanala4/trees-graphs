In this folder a logic is implemented for minimum spanning tree based on kruskals algorithm.
The functions written are Make_a_graph,create_tree,traverse and insert into queue.
->make_a_graph:a graph is created normally by giving an input.Here the count of edges should be less than the number of edges.
maximum no of edges:(n*(n-1))
the values of source and destination should  be in the range of 0 to n
In main function the information of  node,vertex and weights are displayed.
->if the graph is not empty and not greater than no of vertices.then traverse to the next node to find the minimum weight of the edge and store
the node edge and weight.
if the weight in this is less than the previous weight then we store this weight in the list and if it is not less then traverse to the next element
fiinally the edges with minimum weights are stored in the list and are displayed .
