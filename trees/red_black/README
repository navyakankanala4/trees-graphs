in this folder logic is implemented for red_black tree.
the basic operation performed here is insert and display
the basic properties are:
->root should be black
->leaf node should be black
->child of red node will be black
Insertion:
-->Here we insert the node normally as in BST and mark the colour of newly inserted node as red 
if the inserted node is root then change the colour of x as black.
if the color of x's parent is not black or x is not root
a)if x's uncle is red
->change the color of parent and uncle as black
->color of grandparent as red
->change x=x's grandparent,repeat it for new x
B)if x's uncle is black then there are four cases:
->left-left rotation
->right-right rotation
->right-left rotation
->left-right rotation
case 1)if the nodes are in the trianglar form then rotate parent of x.
case 2)if the nodes are in the line then rotate x's grandparent and recolor.
display:
displaying the data of nodes.
